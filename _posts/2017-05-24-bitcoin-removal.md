title: End of Bitcoin support
---

Due to high transaction fees, we’re removing [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) support from Paspagon. Support will cease after 2017-05-31, 2 P.M. UTC, though it is possible for this period to be extended on request.

This change will make [BlackCoin](https://blackcoin.co) the only currency supported by Paspagon. Additionally, we’ve lowered payment fees for BlackCoin. Current fees for the (only one) `s3-us-west-2` region can be checked at [its status page](https://s3-us-west-2.paspagon.com).

Historical data on average Bitcoin transaction fees can be found on the [bitcoinfees.info](https://bitcoinfees.info/) website.
