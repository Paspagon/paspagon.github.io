A [Jekyll plugin which allows selling blog posts using Paspagon](https://github.com/KrzysiekJ/jekyll-paspagon) has been released. Key features are:

* Support for multiple formats (HTML, EPUB, AZW3, MOBI, PDF and more).
* Granular payment settings. An user can decide if and when a particular format should be paid, for each post individually.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware static site generator with many importers available, allowing migration from sources like Wordpress or RSS. There is a wide range of options for deploying a Jekyll site, including an ordinary static website hosting, free Github Pages service and Amazon S3.
